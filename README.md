## Hi there 👋

My name is Aisari Amirov. 

I am currently a Penultimate year student at BSc Computer Science. 

Currently achieving a first-class degree. Passionate about AI and machine learning 🤖, I aspire to build impactful tools that improve people's lives 🌍.

I’ve completed internships as a full-stack web developer, led projects like Sarqyt, and participated in hackathons (including at Oxford!) 🏆. My experience includes machine learning models, web development, and building Telegram bots.

Always curious, always learning.
